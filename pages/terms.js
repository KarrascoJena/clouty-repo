        We are pleased to offer you access to our Website and the ability to
        participate in our fantasy sports contests of skill, other content,
        products, services, and promotions (collectively the
        &quot;Services&quot;) that we may provide from our Website, subject to
        these Terms of Use (the &quot;Terms of Use&quot;, or “Terms”), our
        privacy policy (the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;) and the Official Rules
        and Regulations for the applicable contests and promotions (the

        the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy, the &quot;Agreements&quot;).

      <p className='f5 b'>CONSIDERATION</p>
      <p className='f5'>
        You agree to these Terms of Use by accessing or using the Website,
        registering for Services offered on the Website, or by accepting,
        uploading, submitting or downloading any information or content from or
        to the Website. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS OF
        USE, DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE. These Terms of Use constitute a legal

      <p className='f5 b'>CONTEST ENTRY</p>
      <p className='f5'>
        Users will be able to visit the Website and view the games available for
        entry (the &quot;Contests&quot;). Each individual Contest that is not
        free to enter has an entry fee listed in US dollars. When you select to
        participate in a Contest and complete the entry process, the listed
        amount of US dollars will be debited from your Clouty account.
      </p>
      <p className='f5 b'>CONTEST OF SKILL</p>
      <p className='f5'>
        Contests offered on the Website are contests of skill. Winners are
        determined by the objective criteria described in the Contest deadline,
        roster, Rules, scoring, and any other applicable documentation
        associated with the Contest. From all entries received for each Contest,
        winners are determined by the individuals who use their skill and
        knowledge of relevant sports information and fantasy sports rules to
        accumulate the most points according to the corresponding scoring rules.
        The Website and Contests may not be used for any form of illicit
        gambling.
      </p>
      <p className='f5 b'>CONTEST STATISTICS AND LIVE SCORING</p>
      <p className='f5'>
        To the extent that we offer &apos;live&apos; statistics during gameplay,
        all &apos;live&apos; statistics and other information provided through
        the Clouty website and related information sources are unofficial. Live
        sports statistics and their respective components are offered for
        informational and/or entertainment purposes only and are not used to
        determine the results of our Contests. While Clouty and the third
        parties used to provide the Clouty Services use reasonable efforts to
        include accurate and up-to-date information, neither Clouty nor its
        third party providers warrant or make any representations of any kind
        with respect to the information provided through the Clouty website and
        related information sources. Clouty and its third party providers shall
        not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, usefulness, or
        availability of any information transmitted or made available via the
        Clouty Website and related information sources, and shall not be
        responsible or liable for any error or omissions in that information.

        portion thereof) warrant doing so. Notification of such changes may be
        provided by Clouty to its customers but will not be required.

        deemed to create a partnership, agency, trust arrangement, fiduciary
        relationship or joint venture between you and Clouty. No professional or

        If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of
        competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not
        affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use,
        which shall remain in full force and effect.
      </p>{' '}
      <p className='f5'>
        No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or
        continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Clouty&apos;s
        failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall
        not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
      </p>{' '}
      <p className='f5'>
        Clouty reserves the right to amend these Terms of Use at any time and
        without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of

        If you continue to use the Services after we change the Terms of Use,
        you accept all changes. The failure of Clouty to comply with any
        provision of these Terms of Use due to an act of God, hurricane, war,
        fire, riot, earthquake, terrorism, act of public enemies, actions of
        governmental authorities outside of the control of the Company
        (excepting compliance with applicable codes and regulations) or other
        force majeure event will not be considered a breach of these Terms of
